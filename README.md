# Foobot-and-AirVisual
This is a Crestron project that includes S# drivers for integrating a Crestron system with a Foobot
air quality monitor and for downloading outdoor air quality data from AirVisual.  The combination 
of the 2 provides indoor and outdoor air quality data for a Crestron smart home system.
